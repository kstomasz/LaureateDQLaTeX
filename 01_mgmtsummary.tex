\section*{This is a Management Summary}

This report analyzes the financial statements of WhiteRiver Corp.
with the following structure:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Chapter 1 performs a cash flow calculation. 
  \item Chapter 2 analyses the data obtained. 
\end{itemize}

\section*{Observations}

Though demonstrating a high profitability, the company shows a strong increase
in liquidity, a strong decrease in gearing, a possibly reduced debt capacity,
and, most importantly, very unusually high depreciation. As a result, we see
this business at a \emph{substantial risk}.
