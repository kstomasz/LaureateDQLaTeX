\begin{quote}

Organisations face a constant battle in choosing between liquidity and
profitability. A certain degree of both is essential for an entity to survive,
grow and prosper. But managers must constantly choose between the two. Every
investment decision means choosing between liquidity (spending cash) and
increasing future profitability (e.g., by buying new and more efficient
equipment).

   \begin{enumerate}
\item Discuss this ongoing dilemma and its relationship to \gls{glos:accrualsaccounting}. 
\item Explain why profitability is not the same as liquidity and how both are reflected in published financial statements. 
\item Describe how the lack of either could cause an entity to go out of business. 
\item Base your answer upon your reading, further research and your own experience.
   \end{enumerate}
