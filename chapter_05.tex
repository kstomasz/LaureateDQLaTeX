With the income statement being prepared according to the
\gls{glos:accrualsconvention}, a high profitability does not guarantee for the
company to pay its obligations.
Profitability and liquidity are strongly related, and while
they depend on industry, company size, environment and term, having ``enough
cash'' is  the ``conditio sine qua non,'' especially for \glspl{sme}. Only then
companies can strategize and reallocate
 short-term to long-term investments to boost profitability or follow other
 goals.

As a result, while profitability is the ultimate goal, liquidity is needed to
get there on a sustainable basis.
