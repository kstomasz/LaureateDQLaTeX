===============

This is a sample project structure for LaTeX that works well with both
TeXlipse as well as Sublime Text with the optional LaTeXing package. to
launch the project with TeXlipse, just import the project structure into
Eclipse as a LaTeX project, and you are good to go. You can replace your
build commands by referring to the Makefile. Likewise, if you want to
utilize the project with Sublime Text, just open directly the file
document.sublime-workspace in Sublime Text, and you are good to go.
