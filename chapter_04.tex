From our own experience with an \gls{sme}, a low liquidity, especially while
building the company, creates a constant risk; the entrepreneur battles ``with
the back to the wall,'' and even the slightest increase in days payables
outstanding in particular, or the C2C cycle in general can push the company over
the edge. In Germany, a \emph{bon mot} asks to wait for
five years trust a company to survive.
With low payment morale, even high profitability cannot help with a 
deteriorating cash balance; and a bank gives no credit for ``possibly high
profitability'' if cash reserves continue to be consumed.
From a large corporation's view, this is quite different: Large cash reserves
allow for expansion through mergers and acquisitions, yet the entire business is
normally not at stake. Interestingly, companies such as Amazon can afford to not
be profitable over years in order to improve their market position.
