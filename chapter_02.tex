According to \citeauthor{Braga:1995rr}, ``the balance between adequate
\gls{glos:liquidity} and satisfactory \gls{glos:profitability} is a constant
challenge to financial management.'' (\citeyear[31]{Braga:1995rr})

\subsection{Liquidity} \label{sec:liquidity}

\citeauthor{Arnold:2008wd}  (\citeyear[537]{Arnold:2008wd}) gives three
fundamental reasons for holding cash:

\begin{itemize}
  \item To pay \emph{daily expenses}  such as salaries, materials, and taxes.
  \item To cope with \emph{uncertainty}  and eventual downturns with regards
  to future cash flows.
  \item To allow for \emph{highly profitable investments}  what would require
  \emph{immediate payment} .
\end{itemize}




% ``The lender may require the business to maintain a certain level of liquidity
% during the period of the loan. This would typically be a requirement that the
% borrower business's current ratio is maintained at, or above, a specified level.'' \citep[330]{Atrill:2010ys}
