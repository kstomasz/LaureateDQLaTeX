% Usage:
% \gls{glos:AD} is pretty interesting. If we have a cross reference from
% the acronyms, we can also directly go to that using \gls{AD}; this
% requires then that over there, we have something like

\def\descstakeholder{According to \citeauthor{Donaldson:1995uq}, anyone
who has a ``stake, (i.e., potential benefit)''  (\citeyear[86]{Donaldson:1995uq}), in the 
company, i.e., they consider
the Stanford Research Institute's definition of
stakeholders as ``those groups without whose support the organization would cease to exist''
(\citeyear[72]{Donaldson:1995uq}) as too narrow,  and while they hold that ``it is
essential to draw a clear line between influencers and stakeholders,''
(\citeyear[loc. cit.]{Donaldson:1995uq}) they see managers not only as
``referees'' between the two stakeholder groups of investors and employees, but emphasize
``the fact that managers of a firm are one of its most important and powerful
constituencies.'' (\citeyear[loc.
cit.]{Donaldson:1995uq}) The analysis that
\citeauthor{Donaldson:1995uq} take is oriented towards a normative argument 
which works out the responsibility of managers in that they ``\emph{should}
acknowledge diverse stakeholder interests and  \emph{should} attempt to respond
to them within a mutually supportive framework because that's a moral
requirement for the legitimacy of the management function.'' 
(\citeyear[p. 87, emphasis theirs]{Donaldson:1995uq}).}
